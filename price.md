# Price Calculator

This is a simple price calculator that takes the price of the item, quantity, and tax rate as input and calculates the total price including tax. 
## Usage

To use the price calculator, simply enter the price, quantity, and tax rate in the respective fields and click the "Calculate" button. The total price including tax will be displayed in the "Result" field.
## Example

For example, if the price of the item is $10, the quantity is 2, and the tax rate is 10%, the total price including tax would be:

$10 * 2 * 1.1 = $22

So the "Result" field would display $22.
